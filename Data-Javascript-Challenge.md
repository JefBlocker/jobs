# Emcien JavaScript Engineering Challenge

Please download the data set [disasters.csv](https://github.com/emcien/jobs/blob/master/disasters.csv) that contains information about natural disasters occuring in Georgia from 2010 to 2013.

Your task is to create a JavaScript oriented interface to this data in one or more of the following ways:

- Parse and then provide an interface to edit the data
- Visualize the data in an intuitive and interesting way
- Connect with an external API to enhance the data using additional sources of data

While you can certainly write code that attempts to do all three, we would recommend primarily focusing on one in a way that
shows your skills and is easy to understand for the user. This is your time to impress us!

We would like to see the code, and the app running somewhere if possible (you can use sites like [codepen](http://codepen.io/) and [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) to host it.)
