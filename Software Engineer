Software Engineer for Complex Web Applications (Atlanta)

Emcien develops four products based on a patented pattern-detection engine. Using the discrete mathmatical concept of sparse matrix graphs, these applications solve problems in manufacturing, retail, and law enforcement. This approach, plus big data sets, create challenging problems for our Software Engineers.

We are looking for more developers to join our team. If you mastered the concepts behind web development and have experience dealing with the web stack, Emcien is willing to train you in Ruby on Rails. This position is an excellent opportunity for anyone who wants to make the transition from Java, .NET, Python, PHP, or oCaml. If you are an experienced Rails engineer, Emcien presents some unique and challenging problems to solve. 

Since we are a small, delta-force team of developers, each team member dives into a variety of code. Although you do not have to be an expert in each of these areas, this position will expose you to CoffeeScript, MySql, Amazon RDS, SASS, HAML, Backbone.js, and several other technologies. This means that your skills will advance with the latest ideas and innovations in web development.
