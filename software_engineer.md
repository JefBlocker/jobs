#Software Engineer (Atlanta)#

[Emcien](http://emcien.com) develops four products based on a patented pattern-detection engine. Using the [discrete mathematical concept of sparse matrix graphs](http://emcien.com/technology/) we build applications delivering:
  
  * [Recommendation Engines](http://emcien.com/use-cases/recommendation-engine/) 
  * [Predictive Analytics](http://emcien.com/use-cases/predictive-analytics/)
  * [Continuous Network Analysis](http://emcien.com/use-cases/continuous-network-analysis/)
  * [Conversation Analysis](http://emcien.com/use-cases/conversation-analysis/)

This work is both challenging and rewarding. We work closely with our research department inventing new ideas and solutions to difficult, un-solved problems. Engineers who want to flex their intellectual muscles do their best work at Emcien. We do not build simple CRUD applications like [facebook-for-cats](http://catmoji.com).

**Benefits of working in Engineering at Emcien include:**

  * The daily opportunity to learn from people who specialize in data structures, data science & algorithms, user interface design, and other disciplines
  * The ability to ‘own’ your work
  * Time to refactor and rewrite parts of the code base that accrues technical debt (we love breaking sub-systems into gems)
  * The opportunity to debate topics like “is Die Hard a Christmas movie?” (the answer is `yes`)

We are looking for a smart individual who has a handle on the concepts behind web development. Emcien is willing to train you in Ruby on Rails. This position is an excellent opportunity for anyone who wants to make the transition from Python, PHP, Java, .NET or oCaml.

If you are an experienced Rails engineer, Emcien presents unique and challenging problems to solve.

===

**Skills & Requirements**
  * Experience with a dynamic language such as Python or Ruby
  * Experience with a web framework such as Rails, Django, CakePHP, Express.js
  * Experience with the unix command-line tools (beyond `ls` and `cd`)
  * Basic understanding of relational databases

**Nice to Have**
  * Experience with Ruby on Rails
  * Experience with structured Javascript (server-side or client-side)
  * Understanding of testing methodologies
  * Experience with (or interest in) Elasticsearch, Redis, Hadoop, and other data stores
  * Experience using git

**Getting a Sense of How You Think**

When applying to Emcien, we like to see your work to get a sense of how you solve problems. We prefer to see open-source projects you have contributed to or a public repository largely written by you.

Another way of seeing how you think is completing our [Emcien Engineering Test](https://github.com/emcien/jobs/blob/master/engineering-test.md)

A question from this test is:

```
An ant is walking on the squares of a 5x5 grid - it starts in the center square.

Each second, it will choose (with equal probability)
to do one of the following:

- Move north one square
- Move south one square
- Move east one square
- Move west one square
- Do not move

If it cannot perform the action it has decided on (move west while on the 
west edge, for example), it sits in place.

After one second, it has a 20% chance of being in the center, and a 20% chance
of being in each adjacent square. (and a 0% chance of being in any
other square on the board).

You may ignore floating point error accumulation.

Questions:
- What is the probability that the ant is on the center square after 15 seconds?
- What is the probability that the ant is on one of the outermost squares after 1 hour?
```

For the complete test, [go here](https://github.com/emcien/jobs/blob/master/engineering-test.md). When completing this test, please provide any notes of how you derived your solutions. The correct answer is not the prime objective (because there are often several ‘correct’ answers) —- the intent is to get a feel of your thought process.

**To apply, please send us:**
  * Your resume to devjobs@emcien.com
  * Either:
   * Your answers to the [Emcien Engineering Test](https://github.com/emcien/jobs/blob/master/engineering-test.md)
   * Public repositories of projects written _largely by you_ attempting to solve some real problem

Notes:
  * Emcien does not sponsor any Visas
  * All Web Developers must work out of our Atlanta Headquarters
