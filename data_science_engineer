#Data Science Engineer (Atlanta)#

[Emcien](http://emcien.com) develops four products based on a patented pattern-detection engine. Using the [discrete mathematical concept of sparse matrix graphs](http://emcien.com/technology/) we build applications delivering:
  
  * [Recommendation Engines](http://emcien.com/use-cases/recommendation-engine/) 
  * [Predictive Analytics](http://emcien.com/use-cases/predictive-analytics/)
  * [Continuous Network Analysis](http://emcien.com/use-cases/continuous-network-analysis/)
  * [Conversation Analysis](http://emcien.com/use-cases/conversation-analysis/)

This work is both challenging and rewarding. We work closely with our research department inventing new ideas and solutions to difficult, un-solved problems. Engineers who want to flex their intellectual muscles do their best work at Emcien. We do not build basic or pointless applications like [facebook-for-cats](http://catmoji.com).

**Benefits of working in Engineering at Emcien include:**

  * The daily opportunity to learn from people who specialize in data structures, data science & algorithms, user interface design, and other disciplines
  * The ability to ‘own’ your work
  * Time to refactor and rewrite parts of the code base that accrues technical debt (we love breaking sub-systems into gems)
  * The opportunity to debate topics like “is Die Hard a Christmas movie?” (the answer is `yes`)

We are looking for a smart individual who has a handle on the concepts behind web development; Emcien is willing to train you in Ruby on Rails. This position is an excellent opportunity for anyone who wants to make the transition from Python, PHP, Java, .NET or NodeJS.

If you are an experienced Rails engineer, Emcien presents unique and challenging problems to solve.

===

**Skills & Requirements**
  * Experience with a dynamic language such as Python or Ruby
  * Experience with a web framework such as Rails, Django, CakePHP, Express.js
  * Experience with the unix command-line tools (beyond `ls` and `cd`)
  * Basic understanding of relational databases

**Nice to Have**
  * Experience with Ruby on Rails
  * Experience with structured Javascript (server-side or client-side)
  * Understanding of testing methodologies
  * Experience with (or interest in) Elasticsearch, Redis, Hadoop, and other data stores
  * Experience using git

**Getting a Sense of How You Think**

When applying to Emcien, we like to see your work to get a sense of how you solve problems. We prefer to see open-source projects you have contributed to or a public repository largely written by you.

Another way that we can see how you think is for you to complete our [Emcien Engineering Test](https://github.com/emcien/jobs/blob/master/engineering-test.md), a short set of questions the check respectively (1) your ability to read documentation, (2) your ability to solve straightforward problems with code, and (3) your ability to model a less straightforward problem.

**To apply, please send us:**
  * Your resume to devjobs@emcien.com
  * One or more of:
   * Your answers to the [Emcien Engineering Test](https://github.com/emcien/jobs/blob/master/engineering-test.md)
   * Public repositories of projects written largely by you attempting to solve a real problem
   * Solutions to a fair number of Project Euler problems (20+) in a language of your choice.

Notes:
  * Emcien does not sponsor any Visas
  * All Developers must work out of our Atlanta Headquarters
