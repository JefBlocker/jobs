# Frontend Engineer

Emcien offers a suite of analytical applications that reveal patterns in data streams and actionable
tasks for fun and profit. Emcien's analytics are based on innovative technology that leverages
proprietary graph algorithms to eliminate the need for tedious data modeling and long implementation
cycles. Our stack is primarily Ruby/Rails, Coffeescript/Backbone, and C with a smattering of other
tech where useful.

We are seeking a frontend developer to add to our engineering-centered organization â€” Ideal candidate
