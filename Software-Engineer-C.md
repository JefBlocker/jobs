#Software Engineer for Data Science Product - Focus on C Language#

[Emcien](http://emcien.com) develops two products ([Scan](http://emcien.com/scan/) & [Patterns](http://emcien.com/patterns/)) based on a patented pattern-detection engine. Using the discrete mathematical concept of sparse matrix graphs, we build applications solving a diverse set of interesting business problems.

As a Software Engineer with a focus on the C language, your day-to-day work is a balance of software engineering and data science. Your work will range from:

  * **Whiteboard, Conceptual Discussions** where we wrestle through ideas like conditional probability and belief propagation. Time-on-whiteboard is mainly to flesh out ideas, bookmark good ones, and agree on next steps in exploring hunches.
  
  * **Writing Code** or fingers-on-keyboards is when we build our applications. Since we own our codebase for the long haul, we have an intense focus on [code smell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell), refactoring, pair programming, and product excellence. While we have high individual standards, we work closely as a team to share ideas, mentor, and train. We have weekly deep-dives into engineering topics, sanctioned side project time, and participate in meetups & hackathons. 
  
  * **Communicating Data Science Concepts to Business End Users** is sometimes the most difficult part. How do you address a business users problem by using language and concepts that non-technical people understand? As you communicate data science results to non-technical people, how do you use methapors that are not too leaky? How do you avoid confirmation biases? Closing the gap between science & user needs one of the most rewarding aspects of our work. 

This work is both challenging and energizing. The payoff is hearing stories from our customers explaining how Patterns, for example, helps solve problems no other solution (R, SAS, Hadoop, etc.) has ever solved. And the icing is that we often solve large problems in minutes, where modeling and map-reduce take hours, if not days.

To see a small sample of our work, please take a look at some of our videos:
  * [Scan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8r6I3wVgYs)
  * [Predictive analytics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kI9LEHMFbU)
  * [Customer churn prevention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NywaC0EBAh8)

We are looking for someone with C experience—"a few classes four years ago" may be sufficient. You should be able to manage the first 5 [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems in C, and you should at least be competent to write [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz), implement a basic singly-linked list, and build a simple unix `cat` utility.

You should also be somewhat familiar with Unix—comfortable getting work done on either the Linux or OSX command line.

**Skills & Requirements**
  * Understands hash tables
  * Familiarity with Ruby (our tests are written in RSpec)
  * Experience with data manipulation (text processing, parsing, etc)
  * Not afraid of pointers
  * Write C Macro wrappers for data structures
  * Experience with using SAS, R, SciPy, or Matlab to do data analysis

**Nice to Have**
  * Experience using git
  * Experience with (or interest in) R, SAS, Hadoop
  * Understanding of testing methodologies
  * Experience with Ruby on Rails

**Getting a Sense of How You Think**
Please provide a sample C program doing *one* of the following:
  * `cat` concatenates stdin with all files listed as arguments and prints the result to stdout.
  * `sort` reads numbers from stdin (one per line), sorts them, and prints them on stdout.
  * `primes` takes one numeric argument 'N', and prints the first N primes to stdout.
  * `euler` solutions to the first five project (euler problems)[https://projecteuler.net/problems]

**To apply, please send us:**
  * Your resume to devjobs@emcien.com
  * One of the sample programs described above
