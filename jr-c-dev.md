## Wanted: Junior C Developer

### The Role

We are looking for someone with basic C experience - "a few classes four years ago" may be sufficient.
You should be able to manage the first 5 Project Euler problems in C, and you should at least be
competent to write FizzBuzz, implement a basic singly-linked list, and build a simple unix 'cat' utility.

You should also be somewhat familiar with Unix - comfortable getting work done on either the Linux
or OSX command line. Bonus points for any of:

- Understands hash tables
- Familiarity with Ruby (our tests are written in RSpec)
- Experience with data manipulation (text processing, parsing, etc)
- Is not afraid of pointers
- Can write C Macro wrappers for data structures
- Has experience with using SAS, R, SciPy, or Matlab to do data analysis

An experienced C developer could also apply if interested - you folk are harder to find and hire, but
we have no specific requirement for a junior-level salary.

No remote work, and we do not sponsor visas.

### About Emcien

Emcien is a data science company with a number of web applications designed as interfaces into
the output of a fairly complex science 'engine'. We deal with very complex data sets, and the
bulk of our data structure operations are performed on graphs (usually in the form of very sparse
matrices).

### The Environment

We are a very small development team - four engineers total, and only one of them works heavily on this
engine. We have an open floor plan, and regularly iterate on our process. Most importantly,
we aren't code-monkeys typing madly under the whip of our project-manager overlords - we do the majority
of the science, design, and architecture for our products; our overlords are whipless, and tend to
present overarching objectives rather than detailed specs.

Contact devjobs@emcien.com with any questions, or with a resume (pdf or text) and a sample C program doing
_one_ of the following:

- `cat`: concatenates stdin with all files listed as arguments and prints the result to stdout.
- `sort`: reads numbers from stdin (one per line), sorts them, and prints them on stdout.
- `primes`: takes one numeric argument 'N', and prints the first N primes to stdout.
- `euler`: solutions to the first five project euler problems (https://projecteuler.net/problems)
