###Linux System Administrator (Atlanta)###

[Emcien](http://emcien.com) develops four products based on a patented pattern-detection engine. Using the discrete mathematical concept of sparse matrix graphs, these applications solve problems in manufacturing, retail, and law enforcement. This approach, plus big data sets, create challenging problems for our Operations and Engineering teams.
We are looking for a Linux System Administrator to join our team.

**Skills & Requirements**

**Our needs vary from:**
- **Cloud Infrastructure Design & Monitoring:** We have four products with multiple customer instances and varied capabilities.
- **Determine Strategies to Deploy Products Behind Customer Firewalls:** Often customers do not want data to leave their premise; we must package our applications to be delivered onto systems outside our direct control. Because these systems may not be easily accessible, the processes for installing and managing them must be robust.
- **Database Optimization:** We store large amount of data in relational databases, and support unusual access patterns into large data sets. Our team look for help understanding and improving the performance of complex queries.

**Qualities we seek:**
- **Problem solving:** Often we have a problem like ‘I want to store our Cisco Firewall logs so that they can be used as a dataset for our research team.’ The ideal system administrator will take a loosely defined requirement, research how to implement a solution, then propose a set of options. He or she will enjoy the creative control over the systems they deploy while working with the team to balance trade-offs and vet ideas. 
- **Research:** We never know what new problems we will have to solve. We are seeking someone who might not have direct experience with something like configuration management or automation, but is able to read the docs, prop up a test bed, and with a little time, understand the tool or library enough to make an informed recommendation.
- **Personal Interest:** Our best technical people love what they do, in and out of the office. We are looking for someone who loves systems & software and is interested in the problems we solve.
