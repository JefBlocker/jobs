#Software Engineer for Data Science Product (Atlanta)#

[Emcien](http://emcien.com) develops two products ([Scan](http://emcien.com/scan/) & [Patterns](http://emcien.com/patterns/)) based on a patented pattern-detection engine. Using the discrete mathematical concept of sparse matrix graphs, we build applications solving a diverse set of interesting business problems.

As a Software Engineer your day-to-day work is a balance of software engineering and data science. Your work will range from:

  * **Whiteboard, Conceptual Discussions** where we wrestle through ideas like conditional probability and belief propagation. Time-on-whiteboard is mainly to flesh out ideas, bookmark good ones, and agree on next steps in exploring hunches.
  
  * **Writing Code** or fingers-on-keyboards is when we build our applications. Since we own our codebase for the long haul, we have an intense focus on [code smell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell), refactoring, pair programming, and product excellence. While we have high individual standards, we work closely as a team to share ideas, mentor, and train. We have weekly deep-dives into engineering topics, sanctioned side project time, and participate in meetups & hackathons. 
  
  * **Communicating Data Science Concepts to Business End Users** is sometimes the most difficult part. How do you address a business users problem by using language and concepts that non-technical people understand? As you communicate data science results to non-technical people, how do you use methapors that are not too leaky? How do you avoid confirmation biases? Closing the gap between science & user needs one of the most rewarding aspects of our work. 

This work is both challenging and energizing. The payoff is hearing stories from our customers explaining how Patterns, for example, helps solve problems no other solution (R, SAS, Hadoop, etc.) has ever solved. And the icing is that we often solve large problems in minutes, where modeling and map-reduce take hours, if not days.

To see a small sample of our work, please take a look at some of our videos:

* [Customer churn prevention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NywaC0EBAh8)

We are looking for a smart individual who has a handle on the concepts behind web development and data science. Emcien is willing to train you in Ruby on Rails. This position is an excellent opportunity for anyone who wants to make the transition from Python, PHP, Java, or .NET.

If you are an experienced Rails engineer, Emcien presents unique and challenging problems to solve.

  * Experience with a dynamic language such as Python or Ruby
  * Experience with a web framework such as Rails, Django, CakePHP, Express.js
  * Experience with the unix command-line tools (beyond `ls` and `cd`)
  * Basic understanding of relational databases

**Nice to Have**

**Getting a Sense of How You Think**

When applying to Emcien, we like to see your work to get a sense of how you solve problems. We prefer to see open-source projects you have contributed to or a public repository largely written by you.

Another way that we can see how you think is for you to complete our [Emcien Engineering Test](https://github.com/emcien/jobs/blob/master/engineering-test.md), a short set of questions the check respectively (1) your ability to read documentation, (2) your ability to solve straightforward problems with code, and (3) your ability to model a less straightforward problem.

**To apply, please send us:**
  * Your resume to devjobs@emcien.com
  * One or more of:
   * Your answers to the [Emcien Engineering Test](https://github.com/emcien/jobs/blob/master/engineering-test.md)
   * Public repositories of projects written largely by you attempting to solve a real problem
   * Solutions to a fair number of Project Euler problems (20+) in a language of your choice.

Notes:
  * Emcien does not sponsor any Visas
  * All Engineers work out of our Atlanta Headquarters
